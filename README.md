# Rhino Linux Issue Tracker

This repository will be the centralised place for us to track bugs, feature requests and proposals.

# How to submit a bug or feature request:

Please use the following guidelines below, to help facilitate communication:


### 1. Use the provided templates

We have created templates available to help you fill out a descriptive bug report or feature request.

### 2. Title formatting

Please be sure to format issue titles like this:
- **Bug Reports:** `bug(<repo>): [title]`
  - Example: `bug(unicorn): Panel is not displaying`
- **Proposals:** `prop(<repo>): [title]`
  - Example: `prop(os): Change installer from calamares`

Once feature proposals have been agreed upon by the team, the issue title will be changed to: `feat(<repo>): [title]`.

- If you are unsure of the repository/component to list in your title, please give your best estimate.

### 3. Scope of Issues

## Contribution process
